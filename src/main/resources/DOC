			when you want to perform any persistent operation in Hibernate then you need to write the Hibernate code with
			following steps.

			1. Write persistence class.
			2.Write the mapping document or use annotation with Persistence class.

			3. client code
			try{
			//Take session factory
			//Take session
			// Begin Traction
			// Perform persistence operation
			//End Traction
			//close session


			}

			catch(Exception e)
			{
			}

			Following problem in above code
			1/ All the above statement are there 5 common operations.
			Writing the same cient code multiples times rapidatily.gives you code duplication problem.

			2. All the method in Hibernate API are throwing common exception called org.hibernate.HibernateExeption
			which is the checked ex because of checked Ex you nedd to write try catch blocks for every program.

			3. There is no clear categorization of ex in Hibernate.



			Above Problems are solved as follows

			1) HibernateTemplate is provided which centralized the Hibernate clint code.
			Usage:
			a. hibernateRemp.save(cust);

			2. InSpring DataAccess , There is one root Ex called DataAccessException which unchecked or runtime.Because
			of unchecked ex you no need to try and catch block fro every program.

			3. There is clear categorization of exception in Spring DataAccess.


			                                   Important Method HibernateTemplate

							1) Serializable save(Object)
							2) void update(Object)
							3) void update(Object, LockMode)
							4)void delete(Object)
							5) void delete(Object, LockMode)

							7) Object load(class, Serilizable)
							8)Object load(Class, Serializable,LockMode)
							9) List loadAll(Class)

							12) List find(hql, Object[])
							13) List findByCriteria(DetachedCriteria) - QBC
							14) List findByCriteria(DC,int,int)
							15) void execute(HibernateCallback hc)
